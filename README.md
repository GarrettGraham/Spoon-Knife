### Well hello there!

This repository is meant to provide you with an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub.

Creating a *fork* is like producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your own personal copy. You may submit *Pull Requests* to help improve the projects of others by offering your changes up to the original project. *Forking* is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After *forking* this repository, you can make some changes to the project and submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls), as practice.

For some more information on how to fork a repository, check our guide ["Forking Projects"](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart:
